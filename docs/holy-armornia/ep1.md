<br>
<blockquote>
The priests of Armonia visit Kielce to hold a memorial ceremony for the deceased, during which Vincent notices traces of a rune spell used by his brother Van to gather the souls of the dead. Olivia reveals that she met Van in Bristia Scar before, where Van used another rune spell to bind the souls of those who died from the Cannon of Concentrated Magic during the Three-Year War. The moth-shaped monster, Breeze, binds the souls of the dead by devouring living souls. Van is trying to resurrect someone by sacrificing innocent lives.<br>
<br>
You gather more information. Kurt reveals that while Montoro created undead by using the living, Van imbued souls of the dead into their original bodies. Gerar Loren reveals Van was responsible for starting the war between Royalists and Republicans. Van is gathering the remnants of the Five Elements. At the end of the trail, you discovers Van is trying to revive a woman named Ornella.<br>
<br>
Conflict soon arises between the priesthood and Memento Mori when Pope Vasnuela III was murdered. Thinking Van has been framed for the murder, Vincent returns to Armonia on the zeppelin designed by Marchetti. You arrive in Armonia Anilio, which used to be a gateway between Vespanola and Illier. You discovers Jurgen to be behind the beast attacks in Armonia Latina. As a reward, Shuran the Mediator sends you on to Archbishop Vega in the cathedral. <br>
<br>
Sirius does not trust Memento Mori, so he heeps throwing you to the beasts, which you discover to have been embedded with strange ores. Archbishop Lennon distrusts Vega, wondering where is the dispatch of crusaders sent to suppress the beasts of Latina. The dispatch was baptized but was not sent out of the city, and a lot of supplies were purchased but not accounted for. Lennon confronts Vega.<br>
<br>
Vega explains that Armonia has existed since the beginning of human history, and has fought to break the link between the present world and the Abyss. William and the First Crusader Unit were dispatched to the basement camp after the energy of Abyss grew stronger. So Sirius leads the 2nd Crusader Unit to join in the holy war. William claims that he never received any supply since dispatched, and they are running of holy water. Saint Anis creates the holy water out of Armonium, the same substance Jurgen used to corrupt the beasts. <br>
<br>
After returning to the basement camp, Sirius got hammered by Bryan the Blacksmith. You learn that Abyss can corrupt even crusaders. Identifying a newly found earring, Sirius concludes that his friend Cepheus had fallen in the war, and is now a monster. Cepheus asks to be released from his pain, you oblige him by slaughtering him. Archbishop Bruno, however, has accepted his abyssal form, and Van appears later to forcefully release his soul. But before Van can be questioned, useless Vincent falls unconscious... You report to Archbishop Vega, who gives you something prepared by the parish - Tears of Sara the Grand Saint.</blockquote>

<li>Collect Earring of Cepheus x1 which is dropped by monsters in Armonia En Celar.</li>
<ul>
<li>Earring of Cepheus is a tradable item under [Misc.] tab of the inventory.</li>
<li>The drop rate is horrendous in v21.77.84. Consider using Field Manual, Explorer Pack (aka Home Premium Service), Pan Pan, etc. to boost drop rate.</li>
<li>Spending too long in En Celar will increase [Degenerate] curse level. Summoners are less affected by this, since ATK penalty does not apply to the summoned monsters.</li>
<li>If you use summoners, bring along a tank. Montoro's skills clear mobs well with an anti-demon rod. Lisa's high evasion may help her survive as well.</li>
</ul>
<li>Talk to Commander William in Armonia Apostadero (H8) to give him Earring of Cepheus.</li>
<li>Trigger a quest dialogue at Armonia En Celar (D7).</li>
<li>Trigger a combat mission (<i>"I Will Save Them!"</i>, 30 minutes) at Armonia En Celar (F5).</li>
<ul>
<li>Reduce Priest Cepheus Jonathan to 50% HP. Vincent and Sirius will help you. Archbishop Bruno will then appear.</li>
<li>Reduce Archbishop Bruno to 50% HP. Vincent and Sirius will help you.</li>
<li>Tip: At the start, run away to let Vincent and Sirius occupy the monster, while you buff up.</li>
<li>Tip: Sirius' normal attacks can inflict [Armor Crash] status, reducing monster's DEF to 0 for 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Tip: Use a long range shooter (e.g. Leonele) to stay out of their area attacks, and capitalize on [Armor Crash] status.</li>
<li>Tip: Archbishop Bruno seems to change targets more easily, so you may want to bring along a tank as well.</li>
</ul>
<li>Talk to Commander William in Armonia Apostadero (H8).</li>
<li>Talk to Archbishop Vega in Armonia Cathedral (D4) for reward.</li>
