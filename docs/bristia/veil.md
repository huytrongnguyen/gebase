<blockquote>
After Veil escapes the prison, he tells his story as his followers clear off the remaining guards. He was a Bristia Army Captain during the Three-Year War. When Caisse's father surrendered Bristia to Vespanola, Veil and his troops left the army to become the Resistance. When Caisse broke through the night siege and disappeared (as told by Olvia <a href="http://starstorm-ge.blogspot.com/2013/05/recruit-olivia.html">here</a>), he came to Veil alone. Veil's followers betrayed him, and Caisse took him prisoner.<br>
<br>
You return with news to Red Hat Pub, finding Heiran, J.D, and Cano in peril. Caisse orders his soldiers to capture everyone. After defeating the soldiers, you meet with Veil again. Veil joins your family to secure allegiance of the Resistance to the Liberation Army. As the temporary commander of the Liberation Army, Heiran gives out orders. Selva and Edward will watch Renauld in Tigres Prison. Raven and Grace will watch Kess. Since J.D got nerfed, he can only baby-sit Cano. </blockquote>
