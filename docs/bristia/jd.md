# RECRUIT J.D

<div class="post-body entry-content float-container" id="post-body-8934537383649218865">
<a href="http://bluemoonwalzer.blogspot.com/2012/11/jd.html">J.D</a>&nbsp;can be recruited since B1.4.0. The following quests must be done in sequence. I have decided to write/post his quest guide as the other English guides lack details on the annoying questioning and infiltration parts.<br>
<br>
ðŸ†• This guide has been updated to v29.99.94. You do not need to give any item.<br>

<blockquote>
You continue to run from the pursue of Blood Navy. Vice Governor Richelieu asked you to leave Kielce, saying that Caisse has betrayed their ideals for independence by depending on foreign powers (i.e. Republicans and pioneer families from Granado Espada).<br>
<br>
Garcia and Raven continues to support Caisse. Jack and Grace are swayed by Richelieu. Edward remains neutral, while Selva simply doesn't care. They decided that they should investigate further by themselves. It seems Vespanola sent General Renauld too quickly, as if they were already expecting pioneers to return to Bristia.<br>
<br>
Caisse and Olivia visit the Resistance to meet J.D (code name Judgement Day). Cano, Caisse's sister, is revealed to have been recruited by Renauld into the Blood Navy, so J.D promises to protect her. After meeting Cano in the Training Camp at night, Grace surmises that the spy was not Richelieu, but someone closer. General Renauld secretly supports the Resistance and thieves to make Bristians fight among themselves, giving Vespanola an excuse to intervene.<br>
<br>
When Richelieu's Bristia Army attacks Caisse, J.D defends him and is given the death sentence by Renauld. You rescue him and Caisse persuades him to join you.</blockquote>

<b>[120] Red-Eyed Man: Chase of Bloody Navy</b><br>
Prerequisites: Completed <i>[Doubt] Laboratory Search</i> quest (see <a href="http://starstorm-ge.blogspot.com/2013/04/kielce-scenario.html">Bristia Episode 1</a>&nbsp;scenario).<br>
<ol>
<li>Receive quest mail by moving to Kielce.</li>
<li>Talk to Caisse in Bristia Government General via Kielce (F2).</li>
<li>Start a combat mission ("Escape", 30 minutes) in Kielce (J4).</li>
<ul>
<li>Defeat Bloody Navy Officer - Assault (Human AR/DR 61) and her Bloody Navy soldiers (Human AR/DR 58).</li>
</ul>
<li>Start a non-combat mission ("Vice Governor Richelieu") in Kielce (L3). Another non-combat mission ("Thoughts of Six People") will start immediately after the first.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>[120] Red-Eyed Man: The Owner of Royal Guard</b><br>
Prerequisites: Completed the previous quest above.<br>
<ol>
<li>Trigger a combat mission ("A Man With Red Eyes", 30 minutes) in Kielce (F2/F3). <strike>Raven and Grace must be alone in the team (MCC2) from now on until the end of the recruitment quests.</strike></li>
<ul>
<li>J.D (Human, AR/DR 72, ATK 1260) will attack you. You do not have to defeat him. After 1 minute or so, Raven will ask you to retreat to Red Hat Pub (D8). In fact, you can start running towards D8 before Raven even asks.</li>
<li>Move to D8 to start a non-combat mission ("The Owner of Royal Guard").</li>
</ul>
<li>Talk to Major William in Kielce (F2).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>[120]&nbsp;</b><b>Red-Eyed Man:&nbsp;</b><b>Intendment of the Governor</b><br>
Prerequisites: Completed the previous quest above.<br>
<ol>
<li>Talk to various "nameless" stationary guards in Kielce. Ask 5 aides the final question of whether Caisse and/or Olivia have been acting independently. You have the option to ask the final question or end the dialogue.</li>
<ul>
<li>There are 3 types of guardsâ€”aides, general soldiers, and traitors. If you ask the final question to a traitor, you will lose <strike>5,000,000</strike> 50,000 Vis as hush money. If you do not have the money, you cannot talk to any more guards until the next day.</li>
<li>The stationary guards are 3 Government General Guards (E3/F3), 2 Governor Office Guards (G2/H2), 2 Kielce Residence Security Guards (G7), 2 Security Guards (J10), 2 Museum Guards (J6), 2 Perimeter Guards (L3), 2 Internal Affairs Guards (E7), 1 Bascule Bridge Guard (E8), 4 Port Guards (C9/D9), Ship Materials Guard (G3/G4), and Red Hat Security Guard (D8).</li>
<li>Check the initial response of the guard. If he says "<i>What is the matter?</i>", then he is a general soldier and can be ignored. If he says "<i>What is going on? Ah... You?</i>", then he is either an aide or a traitor.</li>
<li>Next, check the guard's response to the 3rd question ("<i>current situation in Bristia</i>"). If he says "<i>We must become independent as a sovereign state.</i>", then he is an aide so you should ask him the final question. If he favors Vespanola's rule, thinks pioneers/thieves are the problem, or wants to defeat the Resistance, then he is a traitor. If he says anything else (e.g. "<i>I cannot answer that.</i>"), simply end the dialogue and talk to him again until he says one of the above responses.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>Start a non-combat mission ("Code Name: Judgment Day") in Shelter of Resistance (F3).</li>
<li>Start a combat mission ("The Sister Rescue Operation", 30 minutes) in Kielce Night (L3).</li>
<ul>
<li>Go pass the sentries at the gates directly in front of the start point. Wait for them to fall asleep (saying "<i>..Zzzz....</i>") before going pass them.</li>
<li>Go across the parade square without entering the detection zones (denoted by a glowing circle around the NPC) of the patrolling Bloody Navy Guards and J.D. There will be another pair of sleepy sentries to sneak pass before you are safe out of the parade square.</li>
<li>Go towards F9/G9. The Bloody Navy - Shield sentry will wake up and start running towards F4.</li>
<li>Kill the Bloody Navy - Shield (HP 110, DR 57, DEF 9999) before he reaches F4. You will do only 1 damage per hit.</li>
<li>Go further into F4 to trigger a dialogue with Cano.</li>
<li>Tip: Movement Speed and ATK Speed are the most important things here, so make use of Assassin Boots, Mystic Potion, Tiger Pet, Hermes Potion, Crescemento Armor (Movement Speed +20%), and Red Lollipop (if available). Invisible Potion will not help here.</li>
<li>Tip: While in the parade square, stack the characters on top of each other to minimize the occupied space.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Tip: J.D is patrolling the parade square as well. If he catches you, you cannot redo the mission for 1 day unless you give 5 White Gold Bars to Bloody Navy Brye in Kielce (I3). Run into a patrolling guard instead if you are unable to avoid J.D.</li>
<li>Tip: You can click on Electric Shock Device to debuff the Bloody Navy - Shield with [Shock] when he enters the area effect of a Shock Device. The clicking character will be disabled for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Tip: To kill the fleeing Bloody Navy - Shield, run ahead of him, then (spacebar) attack him as he passes by. Use Mystic Potion to maximize your ATK Speed. (Do not follow and attack him from behind. Make sure you overtake him before attacking.)</li>
<li>Tip: Since later update no longer forces you to use Grace and Raven (MCC2), you can use a fast moving character (MCC1) instead.</li>
</ul>
