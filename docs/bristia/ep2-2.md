<blockquote>
Heiran tells J.D that Olivia refused to speak of Caisse's location. Garcia finds Caisse's epaulet outside Kielce Lab, but Marchetti denies seeing Caisse on the day of his disappearance. Meanwhile, General Renauld and his Bloody Navy attacks the Government General. You force General Renauld to retreat, and you follow him to Kielce Training Camp where you find a locked door.<br>
<br>
You investigate Resistance Shelter at Serena's prompting, and learn from a ghost that there is a prison beneath the lighthouse there. Ork tells you to find a madman who worked to build the Training Camp years ago. The madman reveals that the locked door leads to the prison beneath the lighthouse. Only 2 keys exist - one with Renauld, another with Caisse. He claims to have seen Caisse entered the door.<br>
<br>
You convince Jenia to travel to Kielce and make the Tigres Prison Key. You confront Caisse inside Tigres Prison, and he claims to be loyal to Vespanola and is planning to weed out the Resistance and Liberation Army. You free Captain Veil, and since the Blood Navy is so nice as to let him keep his crossbows, he successfully escapes from the prison...</blockquote>
