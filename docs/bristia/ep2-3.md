<blockquote>
Heiran finds Cano crying alone, while J.D takes leave to confront and attack Caisse. Edward explores Tigres Prison B5F and spies Renauld and Advisor Tony talking about how Montoro had a laboratory in B8F/B9F for his biological experiments. Edward realizes that Montoro moved to the New Continent because he succeeded. Renauld decides to attack Kielce once a messenger tells him Caisse has been killed by J.D.<br>
<br>
Renauld decides to attack the Resistance first, before taking on the Government General, but his advance is hindered by J.D who brought the zeppelin to attack. Renauld decides to secretly wipe out the Royal Guards as well, when the latter arrives.  However, Caisse appears and reveals that his alliance with Renauld is just an act. The Royal Guards have taken out Renauld's back-up in Tigres Prison. A fight breaks out, and you finally defeat General Renauld.<br>
<br>
Caisse reveals that he planned on betraying Renauld all along, and had Marchetti confine Raven and Grace to keep it secret. When Jack left to find Jurgen, Caisse convinced him to rejoin the fight for independence. Marchetti lied previously about not having met Caisse after his disappearance. In fact, Caisse visited Marchetti and told him about his plans to pretend to side with Renauld. He foresaw that the Republicans will ask for the zeppelin forcefully. Caisse promised to get Veronif away from Simon if Marchetti cooperates by keeping the plan secret and developing the heavy rifle. He also wanted Marchetti to pass the controls of the zeppelin to J.D when the latter arrives. <br>
<br>
As you spread the news of victory in Kielce, Edward recalls the plaza where he met Selva 12 years ago. But it turns out that it was another woman he met in the plaza. Selva reveals that they met 13 years ago at the port... Oops. Caisse presents medals for the heroes of the war, and pledges his gratitude by joining your family.</blockquote>
