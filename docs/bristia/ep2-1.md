<blockquote>
Heiran asks you to search Kielce for Caisse (aka Kess). You discover that Artisan Victor, who knew of Caisse and J.D, was selling weapons to the Resistance. J.D suspects Caisse might be in the old lighthouse that they used to hang out as kids.<br>
<br>
In the old lighthouse, the defeated resistance fighters reveal that Olivia was seen entering the coastal town that was destroyed by the Vespanola's Cannon of Concentrated Magic during the war. <br>
<br>
Despite J.D's advice, Olivia refuses to surrender. You learn from the ghosts that this was Olivia's home town. After a mysterious priest of Armonia advises her to stop wishing for the dead to return, you help J.D to defeat and capture Olivia.</blockquote>
